# Critic Log

The visual **critic** (`.claude/agents/critic.md`) reviews each build's iPhone-size screenshots against App Store screenshots of the top idle games. The build team then ships a new version that addresses every note.

- **SATISFIED** requires 0 bugs, 0 [major] notes and ≤ 3 [minor] notes. A build that fails to load, or has a blocking bug, can never pass.
- **Screenshots:** `screenshots/<version>/` (393×852 @2×). Regenerate with `npx expo export --platform web && python3 scripts/screenshots.py <version>`. `report.json` must show `"errors": []`.
- **Full history:** rounds 1–50 (v0.1 → v5.2) are kept verbatim in [`docs/logs/CRITICLOG-archive.md`](docs/logs/CRITICLOG-archive.md). This file holds only the current state.
- **Owner's standing direction** (the storefront cutaway, sidewalk buttons, tap-only drawer, a WELCOME mat, visible decor tiers, the visual-polish and character bar) lives in the critic brief and holds in every build.

**Next IDs:** bugs **G86**, design notes **D405**.

## Lessons from rounds 15–50 (read before fixing crowd/geometry notes)
- **Overlap fixes kept moving the overlap instead of removing it** (rounds 30–34: the counter lane moved onto the bakers, the outside pause moved onto the mat, the back row moved onto the bakers' feet). Fix crowd notes in `scene/cast.ts`, `scene/timelines.ts` or `scene/layout.ts`. Then prove the fix with a budget in `scene/__tests__/crowd.test.ts` before taking screenshots, and make sure the test could actually fail on the old code.
- **Verify in pixels.** The critic marks a fix open if the screenshot doesn't show it, whatever this log says.
- **Don't remove owner-required elements** while fixing something else. The WELCOME mat was removed once by mistake (G54).
- **Moving one figure moves the overlap onto another** (rounds 47–50, the walk-in vs. driver at the counter): run the whole crowd suite after every route/spot change, not only the budget you are fixing.

## Current state — v5.9, round 57: ✅ SATISFIED (0 bugs, 0 major, 1 minor)
Fixed: D402 (names kept; "need $X" only when cash > 0, maths checked in 04 and 13), D403 (short crossed thumbs), Pier 9 chip ("uses bid cash" in red; the cream-pill state on a green chip isn't in any shot).

| ID | Severity | Where / shot | Note | Concrete fix |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| D404 | minor | 21 University chip | Three lines make the chip overfull: ~3 pt to the dashed border top and bottom vs ~10 pt on its neighbours | While the hint shows: title 15 pt, hint 9 pt / lineHeight 11; or merge to "$1.8M · uses bid cash" (two lines) |

**Next IDs:** G86, D405.
